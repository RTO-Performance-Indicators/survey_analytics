This folder is used to store data that is used in this repository.

Data files are untracked for Git purposes.

TODO: Makefile in root directory can copy and paste data from the shared drive
to this folder.

The only data that is tracked on GitHub is *test.csv*, 
which contains dummy data that can be used to test functions developed in this 
repository. Dummy data is fictional and not based on real data.
