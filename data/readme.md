# README

This folder is used to store data that is required in this repo.

In general, data files are **not tracked** for Git purposes.

TODO: Makefile in root directory can be used to copy and paste data from the 
shared drive to this folder.

The only data that is tracked on GitHub should be *test.csv*, 
which contains dummy data that can be used to test functions developed in this 
repository. 

*test.csv* is entirely fictional.
